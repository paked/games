                <h1>paked's games</h1>

                <p>i try to make games. i'm interested in design which relaxes, provides agency, and respects players. i usually prefer to work without an engine (but don't bash those who do), as it's where I feel most at ease. i design, code, pixel, and sometimes make sounds or music.</p>


                <p>if you're looking for my non-game related work check out <a href="https://harrison.tech">harrison.tech</a>.

                <p>this is a collection of the various things I've worked on over time (be they prototypes or not). it's not a conclusive list, i've only included my REALLY old projects if i was particularly proud of them. i'm going to try write a little post-mortem for each thing at some point.</p>

                                <p>a prototype i initially wanted to complete for Ludum Dare, which ended up taking an extra 2 months due to scope screep. based around mechanics tied together by "electricity" which each mechanic used in it's own way. i killed it as it's scope continued to grow and i realised it'd never be done.</p>
