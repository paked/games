title: "paked's games"
---

<p>i try to make games. i'm interested in design which relaxes, provides agency, and respects players. i usually prefer to work without an engine (but don't bash those who do), as it's where I feel most at ease. i design, code, pixel, and sometimes make sounds or music.</p>

<p>these are some blog-posts you can find on the site:</p>
<ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>this is a collection of the various things I've worked on over time (be they prototypes or not). it's not a conclusive list, i've only included my REALLY old projects if i was particularly proud of them. i'm going to try write a little post-mortem for each thing at some point.</p>

                <p>a prototype i initially wanted to complete for Ludum Dare, which ended up taking an extra 2 months due to scope screep. based around mechanics tied together by "electricity" which each mechanic used in it's own way. i killed it as it's scope continued to grow and i realised it'd never be done.</p>

                <p>a super small prototype i made about cells, virality, and cutting things out. aims to be instructionless, kind of fails at it.</p>

                <p>a Minecraft style voxel "game" with an "editor" save-format and VR support. my first time playing around with 3D programming. built with C++, OpenGL, GLFW, and cmake. using <a href="https://learnopengl.com">learnopengl.com</a> as my learning resource.</p>

                <p>inspired by the design of Jonathan Blow in The Witness and Seymour Papert's writings on learning i set out to try creating my own project which taught a "visual language". the goal was to create an experience which with no instructions someone could play from start to finish.</p>

                <p>a platformer exploring themes of depression, society, and personal sacrifice. built by a pretty edgy year 10 me who had just watched indie game the movie 100 times. was the first time i took game development seriously and approached it as a means of "self expression.</p>
